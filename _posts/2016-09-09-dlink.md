title: DLink DIR-820L Firmware Reversing
---

This page is a collection of project notes, and may not be useful for
anyone but me. Hopefully it's useful to you too.

# Unpacking the Latest Firmware

You can find the latest DIR-820L firmware on D-Link's FTP server:

	ftp://ftp.dlink.ca/PRODUCTS/DIR-820L/DIR-820L_REVA_FIRMWARE_1.06B01.BIN

My router's hardware revision is A, so I got that one.

First, we can take a look at the firmware using binwalk:

![binwalk](/images/binwalk.png)

We can see that it has 3 parts: two LZMA-compressed chunks of data, then a
Squashfs filesystem. According to my readings, the first two chunks are a
bootloader to unpack and install the Squashfs chunk. So we look at that.

`binwalk -e <file>` can be used to extract from a file.  However, doing
this on my Mac resulted in a big jumble of files -- it failed to properly
unpack the SquashFS file. However, one thing that it did successfully do was
pull out a file called "144822.squashfs". This turned out to be just the
SquashFS file without the preceding data. This was easier than seperating the
file using `dd` (what block size am I supposed to use again?), and less hacky
than just writing a Python or C program to do it for me.

### Unpacking the SquashFS File

Unpacking the file proved to be an enormous challenge. For reasons I still
don't entirely understand, the regular `unsquashfs` tool included in
`squashfs-tools` couldn't unpack the file. (I suspect DIY customizations to the
SquashFS format and/or the LZMA compression algorithm by D-Link are the
culprit). Furthermore, LZMA compression still isn't supported by the Linux
kernel, so no using `mount` to just mount the filesystem. So I had to turn to
[`sasquatch`](https://github.com/devttys0/sasquatch).

After booting up a Linux VM and following the install instructions for
`sasquatch`, I was finally able to unpack the file using the
following incantation:
	
	sasquatch -p 1 -le -f -li 144822.squashfs

After looking through the firmware, it seems most pages of interest are POST
requests sent to various `*.cgi` pages. But where are these handled? MIPS
binaries don't have a lot of love from decompilers and RE tools. Thankfully,
somebody else has [done the work for
me](https://github.com/darkarnium/secpub/tree/master/Multivendor/ncc2): the
`ncc2` program handles most POST requests. Solid. My router is patched to the
latest firmware, so presumably the vulnerabilities on that GitHub page have
been patched... right?

More later, once I get time to play with ncc2.
